<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I started my career as an Application Engineer in Kuala Lumpur and now I'm a Senior IT Consultant in Berlin. I've been troubleshooting and maintaining Atlassian Applications since 2014. I'm a Linux lover and during my free time, I do coding and Scripting. Learning Ruby and and infrastructure as code is current focus. In this blog, I share whatever (Geeks related) in my mind. No matter if it's coding related or related to other applications.</p>
