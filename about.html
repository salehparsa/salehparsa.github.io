<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm an Application Engineer based in Kuala Lumpur. At the moment, I'm the engineer of Atlassian Confluence and Crowd. However, I'm familiar with JIRA and other Atlassian stacks as well.
During my free time, I'm coding and learning JAVA. I love learning new technology and scripting languages since it's a next level of communicating within the world. In this blog, I share whatever (Geeks related) in my mind. No matter if it's coding related or related to other applications.</p>
